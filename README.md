# Apache Iceberg Sink Connector
The Apache Iceberg Sink Connector for Kafka Connect is a sink connector for writing data from Kafka into Iceberg tables.

# Features
* Commit coordination for centralized Iceberg commits
* Exactly-once delivery semantics
* Multi-table fan-out
* Row mutations (update/delete rows), upsert mode
* Automatic table creation and schema evolution
* Field name mapping via Icebergâ€™s column mapping functionality

# Installation
The Apache Iceberg Sink Connector is under active development, with early access builds available under
[Releases](https://github.com/tabular-io/iceberg-kafka-connect/releases). You can build the connector
zip archive yourself by running:
```bash
./gradlew -xtest clean build
```
The zip archive will be found under `./kafka-connect-runtime/build/distributions`.

# Configuration

| Property                                   | Description                                                                                                      |

| iceberg.catalog                            | Name of the catalog, default is `iceberg`                                                                        |
| iceberg.catalog.*                          | Properties passed through to Iceberg catalog initialization                                                      |
| iceberg.hadoop-conf-dir                    | If specified, Hadoop config files in this directory will be loaded                                               |
| iceberg.hadoop.*                           | Properties passed through to the Hadoop configuration                                                            |
| iceberg.kafka.*                            | Properties passed through to control topic Kafka client initialization                                           |

If `iceberg.tables.dynamic-enabled` is `false` (the default) then you must specify `iceberg.tables`. If
`iceberg.tables.dynamic-enabled` is `true` then you must specify `iceberg.tables.route-field` which will
contain the name of the table. Enabling `iceberg.tables.upsert-mode-enabled` will cause all appends to be
preceded by an equality delete. Both CDC and upsert mode require an Iceberg V2 table with identity fields
defined.

## Kafka configuration

By default the connector will attempt to use Kafka client config from the worker properties for connecting to
the control topic. If that config cannot be read for some reason, Kafka client settings
can be set explicitly using `iceberg.kafka.*` properties.

### Consumer offsets

Source topic offsets are stored in Kafka Connect consumer group (which is named `connect-<connector name>` by default). 
To reset the source topic offsets of the connector, the Kafka Connect consumer group needs to be reset.

Control topic offsets are stored in a separate, sink-managed consumer group which we'll refer to as the Coordinator 
consumer group. By default, this will be something like `cg-control-<connector-name>-coord` (unless you've configured 
your connector with an explicit `iceberg.control.group-id` in which case it will be something like 
`<iceberg.control.group-id>-coord`). To reset control topic offsets of the connector, the Coordinator consumer group
needs to be reset.

### Message format

Messages should be converted to a struct or map using the appropriate Kafka Connect converter.

## Catalog configuration

The `iceberg.catalog.*` properties are required for connecting to the Iceberg catalog. The core catalog
types are included in the default distribution, including REST, Glue, DynamoDB, Hadoop, Nessie,
JDBC, and Hive. JDBC drivers are not included in the default distribution, so you will need to include
those if needed. When using a Hive catalog, you can use the distribution that includes the Hive metastore client,
otherwise you will need to include that yourself.

To set the catalog type, you can set `iceberg.catalog.type` to `rest`, `hive`, or `hadoop`. For other
catalog types, you need to instead set `iceberg.catalog.catalog-impl` to the name of the catalog class.

### REST example
```
"iceberg.catalog.type": "rest",
"iceberg.catalog.uri": "https://catalog-service",
"iceberg.catalog.credential": "<credential>",
"iceberg.catalog.warehouse": "<warehouse>",
```

### Hive example
NOTE: Use the distribution that includes the HMS client (or include the HMS client yourself). Use `S3FileIO` when
using S3 for storage (the default is `HadoopFileIO` with `HiveCatalog`).
```
"iceberg.catalog.type": "hive",
"iceberg.catalog.uri": "thrift://hive:9083",
"iceberg.catalog.io-impl": "org.apache.iceberg.aws.s3.S3FileIO",
"iceberg.catalog.warehouse": "s3a://bucket/warehouse",
"iceberg.catalog.client.region": "us-east-1",
"iceberg.catalog.s3.access-key-id": "<AWS access>",
"iceberg.catalog.s3.secret-access-key": "<AWS secret>",
```

### Glue example
```
"iceberg.catalog.catalog-impl": "org.apache.iceberg.aws.glue.GlueCatalog",
"iceberg.catalog.warehouse": "s3a://bucket/warehouse",
"iceberg.catalog.io-impl": "org.apache.iceberg.aws.s3.S3FileIO",
```

### Nessie example
```
"iceberg.catalog.catalog-impl": "org.apache.iceberg.nessie.NessieCatalog",
"iceberg.catalog.uri": "http://localhost:19120/api/v1",
"iceberg.catalog.ref": "main",
"iceberg.catalog.warehouse": "s3a://bucket/warehouse",
"iceberg.catalog.io-impl": "org.apache.iceberg.aws.s3.S3FileIO",
```

### Notes
Depending on your setup, you may need to also set `iceberg.catalog.s3.endpoint`, `iceberg.catalog.s3.staging-dir`,
or `iceberg.catalog.s3.path-style-access`. See the [Iceberg docs](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/) for
full details on configuring catalogs.

## Azure ADLS configuration example

When using ADLS, Azure requires the passing of AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, and AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET for its Java SDK. If you're running Kafka Connect in a container, be sure to inject those values as environment variables. See the [Azure Identity Client library for Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-java-stable) for more information.

An example of these would be:
```
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=e564f687-7b89-4b48-80b8-111111111111
AZURE_TENANT_ID=95f2f365-f5b7-44b1-88a1-111111111111
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="XXX"
```
Where the CLIENT_ID is the Application ID of a registered application under [App Registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade), the TENANT_ID is from your [Azure Tenant Properties](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/TenantProperties.ReactView), and the CLIENT_SECRET is created within the "Certificates & Secrets" section, under "Manage" after choosing your specific App Registration. You might have to choose "Client secrets" in the middle panel and the "+" in front of "New client secret" to generate one. Be sure to set this variable to the Value and not the Id.
It's also important that the App Registration is granted the Role Assignment "Storage Blob Data Contributor" in your Storage Account's Access Control (IAM), or it won't be able to write new files there.

Then, within the Connector's configuration, you'll want to include the following:

```
"iceberg.catalog.type": "rest",
"iceberg.catalog.uri": "https://catalog:8181",
"iceberg.catalog.warehouse": "abfss://storage-container-name@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/warehouse",
"iceberg.catalog.io-impl": "org.apache.iceberg.azure.adlsv2.ADLSFileIO",
"iceberg.catalog.include-credentials": "true"
```

Where `storage-container-name` is the container name within your Azure Storage Account, `/warehouse` is the location within that container where your Apache Iceberg files will be written by default (or if iceberg.tables.auto-create-enabled=true), and the `include-credentials` parameter passes along the Azure Java client credentials along. This will configure the Iceberg Sink connector to connect to the REST catalog implementation at `iceberg.catalog.uri` to obtain the required Connection String for the ADLSv2 client

## Google GCS configuration example

```
"iceberg.catalog.type": "rest",
"iceberg.catalog.uri": "https://catalog:8181",
"iceberg.catalog.warehouse": "gs://bucket-name/warehouse",
"iceberg.catalog.io-impl": "org.apache.iceberg.google.gcs.GCSFileIO"
```

## Hadoop configuration

When using HDFS or Hive, the sink will initialize the Hadoop configuration. First, config files
from the classpath are loaded. Next, if `iceberg.hadoop-conf-dir` is specified, config files
are loaded from that location. Finally, any `iceberg.hadoop.*` properties from the sink config are
applied. When merging these, the order of precedence is sink config > config dir > classpath.

# Upgrade

## Upgrading from 0.6.X to 0.7.0

Prior to version 0.7.0, the consumer offsets for the source topics were tracked by both the connect-group-id and the 
control-group-id. It's important to note that the consumer offsets stored in the control-group-id were always considered 
the "source-of-truth" and could be ahead of those tracked by the connect-group-id in exceptional, temporary situations.

Starting from version 0.7.0, consumer offsets for the source topic are now tracked by the connect-group-id _exclusively_ 
i.e. consumer offsets for the source topics will no longer be tracked by the control-group-id. This change is necessary
to eliminate duplicates from zombie tasks. This means that the new "source-of-truth" for source topic consumer offsets 
will be the connect-group-id. 

Unfortunately, this is a breaking change and the upgrade process itself introduces a risk of duplicate records being written to Iceberg. 
If you don't care about a small number of duplicates, you can just upgrade to version 0.7.0 just like any other patch release.
However, if you do want to avoid duplicates during the upgrade process, please read the following general instructions for upgrading connectors safely.
Please note that the following instructions are written assuming you are running Kafka Connect version 3.6.0.
You may need to adjust the approach depending on your version of Kafka Connect and your deployment process.

### Step 1 
Stop all existing Iceberg Sink connectors running on the Kafka Connect cluster.  
We need to stop the connectors because we will potentially be resetting consumer offsets for these connectors later and it is not possible to do this without stopping the connectors.

You can stop a connector via the Kafka Connect REST API e.g.
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>/stop
```

### Step 2
Fetch the current consumer offsets of the connect-group-id and the control-group-id.    
The connect-group-id will be something like `connect-<connector-name>`.
By default, the control-group-id will be something like `cg-control-<connector-name>` unless you've configured your connector with an explicit `iceberg.control.group-id`.

Be careful not to confuse the control-group-id with the coordinator-consumer-group-id.
The coordinator-consumer-group-id looks very similar to the control-group-id but has a `-coord` suffix e.g. `cg-control-<connector-name>-coord`.
We are only interested in the **connect-group-id** and **control-group-id** for the purposes of this migration.
You should _not_ interact with the **coordinator-consumer-group-id** for the purposes of this migration.

You can retrieve the current consumer offsets for a given consumer-group-id using the `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` tool e.g.
```bash
./kafka-consumer-groups.sh \
--bootstrap-server <bootstrap-server-url> \
--describe \
--group <consumer-group-id>

# Consumer group 'connect-my-connector' has no active members.
# GROUP                        TOPIC           PARTITION  CURRENT-OFFSET  LOG-END-OFFSET  LAG             CONSUMER-ID     HOST            CLIENT-ID
# connect-my-connector         my-topic-name   0          900             1000            100             -               -               -

# Consumer group 'cg-control-my-connector' has no active members.
# GROUP                        TOPIC           PARTITION  CURRENT-OFFSET  LOG-END-OFFSET  LAG             CONSUMER-ID     HOST            CLIENT-ID
# cg-control-my-connector      my-topic-name   0          1000            1000            0               -               -               -
```

### Step 3

Move the consumer offsets for the connect-group-id forward so that they match those of the control-group-id, if necessary.   
If the consumer offsets for the connect-group-id and the control-group-id are already the same, no action is needed for 
this step. 
If however you see that the connect-group-id consumer offsets are behind those of the control-group-id, you will need to 
move the consumer offsets of the connect-group-id forward to match those of the control-group-id.
Note: It is impossible for the consumer offsets of the connect-group-id to be ahead those of the control-group-id for 
connector version < 0.7.0. 

You can reset consumer offsets for the connect-group-id using the Kafka Connect REST API e.g.
```bash
curl -X PATCH \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{ "offsets": [ { "partition": { "kafka_topic": "my_topic_name", "kafka_partition": 0 }, "offset": { "kafka_offset": 1000 } } ] }' \
localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>/offsets
# {"message": "The Connect framework-managed offsets for this connector have been altered successfully. However, if this connector manages offsets externally, they will need to be manually altered in the system that the connector uses."}
```

### Step 4

If you have successfully completed the above steps for all Iceberg Sink connectors running on the Kafka Connect cluster, 
it is now safe to update the Iceberg Sink Connector version on all workers in the Kafka Connect cluster to version 0.7.0.

You can check the installed connector version using the Kafka Connect REST API e.g.
```bash
curl localhost:8083/connector-plugins
# [{"class": "io.tabular.iceberg.connect.IcebergSinkConnector", "type": "sink", "version": "1.5.2-kc-0.7.0"}]
```

### Step 5

Once the Iceberg Sink Connector version on the cluster has been updated to 0.7.0, it is safe to resume the connectors 
that we stopped in step 1.

You can resume a connector via the Kafka Connect REST API e.g.
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>/resume
```

At this point, the upgrade process is complete.  

Note: The now unused control-group-id will eventually be removed from Kafka automatically (by default after 7 days) so 
no special action is necessary there.

# Examples

## Initial setup

### Source topic
This assumes the source topic already exists and is named `events`.

### Control topic
If your Kafka cluster has `auto.create.topics.enable` set to `true` (the default), then the control topic will be automatically created. If not, then you will need to create the topic first. The default topic name is `control-iceberg`:
```bash
bin/kafka-topics  \
  --command-config command-config.props \
  --bootstrap-server ${CONNECT_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS} \
  --create \
  --topic control-iceberg \
  --partitions 1
```
*NOTE: Clusters running on Confluent Cloud have `auto.create.topics.enable` set to `false` by default.*

### Iceberg catalog configuration
Configuration properties with the prefix `iceberg.catalog.` will be passed to Iceberg catalog initialization.
See the [Iceberg docs](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/) for details on how to configure
a particular catalog.

## Single destination table
This example writes all incoming records to a single table.

### Create the destination table
```sql
CREATE TABLE default.events (
    id STRING,
    type STRING,
    ts TIMESTAMP,
    payload STRING)
PARTITIONED BY (hours(ts))
```

### Connector config
This example config connects to a Iceberg REST catalog.
```json
{
"name": "events-sink",
"config": {
    "connector.class": "io.tabular.iceberg.connect.IcebergSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "2",
    "topics": "events",
    "iceberg.tables": "default.events",
    "iceberg.catalog.type": "rest",
    "iceberg.catalog.uri": "https://localhost",
    "iceberg.catalog.credential": "<credential>",
    "iceberg.catalog.warehouse": "<warehouse name>"
    }
}
```

## Multi-table fan-out, static routing
This example writes records with `type` set to `list` to the table `default.events_list`, and
writes records with `type` set to `create` to the table `default.events_create`. Other records
will be skipped.

### Create two destination tables
```sql
CREATE TABLE default.events_list (
    id STRING,
    type STRING,
    ts TIMESTAMP,
    payload STRING)
PARTITIONED BY (hours(ts));

CREATE TABLE default.events_create (
    id STRING,
    type STRING,
    ts TIMESTAMP,
    payload STRING)
PARTITIONED BY (hours(ts));
```

### Connector config
```json
{
"name": "events-sink",
"config": {
    "connector.class": "io.tabular.iceberg.connect.IcebergSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "2",
    "topics": "events",
    "iceberg.tables": "default.events_list,default.events_create",
    "iceberg.tables.route-field": "type",
    "iceberg.table.default.events_list.route-regex": "list",
    "iceberg.table.default.events_create.route-regex": "create",
    "iceberg.catalog.type": "rest",
    "iceberg.catalog.uri": "https://localhost",
    "iceberg.catalog.credential": "<credential>",
    "iceberg.catalog.warehouse": "<warehouse name>"
    }
}
```

## Multi-table fan-out, dynamic routing
This example writes to tables with names from the value in the `db_table` field. If a table with
the name does not exist, then the record will be skipped. For example, if the record's `db_table`
field is set to `default.events_list`, then the record is written to the `default.events_list` table.

### Create two destination tables
See above for creating two tables.

### Connector config
```json
{
"name": "events-sink",
"config": {
    "connector.class": "io.tabular.iceberg.connect.IcebergSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "2",
    "topics": "events",
    "iceberg.tables.dynamic-enabled": "true",
    "iceberg.tables.route-field": "db_table",
    "iceberg.catalog.type": "rest",
    "iceberg.catalog.uri": "https://localhost",
    "iceberg.catalog.credential": "<credential>",
    "iceberg.catalog.warehouse": "<warehouse name>"
    }
}
```

## Change data capture
This example applies inserts, updates, and deletes based on the value of a field in the record.
For example, if the `_cdc_op` field is set to `I` then the record is inserted, if `U` then it is
upserted, and if `D` then it is deleted. This requires that the table be in Iceberg v2 format.
The Iceberg identifier field(s) are used to identify a row, if that is not set for the table,
then the `iceberg.tables.default-id-columns` or `iceberg.table.\<table name\>.id-columns`configuration
can be set instead. CDC can be combined with multi-table fan-out.

### Create the destination table
See above for creating the table

### Connector config
```json
{
"name": "events-sink",
"config": {
    "connector.class": "io.tabular.iceberg.connect.IcebergSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "2",
    "topics": "events",
    "iceberg.tables": "default.events",
    "iceberg.tables.cdc-field": "_cdc_op",
    "iceberg.catalog.type": "rest",
    "iceberg.catalog.uri": "https://localhost",
    "iceberg.catalog.credential": "<credential>",
    "iceberg.catalog.warehouse": "<warehouse name>"
    }
}
```
